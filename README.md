## Solana Functionality Implementation

Description
This project is dedicated to implementing distinct functionalities for buttons within an existing frontend project. The main goals encompass creating a new Solana account and facilitating an airdrop, establishing a connection to the Phantom Wallet, and executing SOL transfers between the newly generated account and the connected accounts. This serves as a solution for a Metacraft challenge within the Solana module.
